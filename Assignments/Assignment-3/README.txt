The files contained in this folder are:
pi_approx.ipynb for question 1
medal_pie_chart.ipynb for question 2
average_temperatures.ipynb for question 3
xy_plot for question 4

Question 1:
I used a function for each rho, tau and mu
In each function, there is a for loop that iterates from 0 to the number passed into the function
This loop adds each value of the function at the index and returns the sum
The sum is the approximation of pi

Question 2:
I represented each country's medal count as a fraction of the total medals of all countries and displayed these values onto a pie chart

Question 3
I read each .dat file and stored each data file in an array
I used these values to plot them separately (by city) onto a single graph
I then changed the x-axis label to each month and added a legend to identify which city is what colour

Question 4:
I used the 1st row of the .dat file as the x-values and the 2nd row as the y-values
I plotted these values onto a scatter plot
I tried to implement the logical indexing to plot the blue and green areas but it resulted in errors (commented out)
I used a for and if statement to display the blue and green areas
